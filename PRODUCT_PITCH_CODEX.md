# ml.ink: AI That Deploys on Government Infrastructure
## From “idea” to “running service” in minutes—without leaving your environment

### What it is

**ml.ink** is a deployment platform that lets your teams use AI assistants (including **OpenAI Codex**) to **stand up real applications inside government-controlled infrastructure**—on‑prem, private cloud, or dedicated servers.

It turns the slowest part of software delivery—getting a service safely live—into a repeatable, governed process. Instead of waiting on tickets, dashboards, and handoffs, teams can go from “AI wrote it” to “it’s running” with consistent controls and clear accountability.

### Why this matters for government

Government organizations are under pressure to modernize quickly, but they face real constraints:

- **Data sensitivity**: not everything can run on public platforms.
- **Operational risk**: untrusted code and third‑party packages must be contained.
- **Staffing reality**: a small platform team supports many mission teams.
- **Accountability**: deployments must be attributable and reviewable.

AI speeds up coding; it does not solve deployment governance. **ml.ink is the missing piece that makes AI “shippable” inside government boundaries.**

### What you get

**1) Faster delivery with guardrails**
- Stand up internal tools, dashboards, APIs, and services quickly.
- Use standard templates and policies so deployments are consistent across teams.

**2) Sovereignty by default**
- Run the platform where you need it: data centers, private networks, private cloud accounts, or dedicated hardware.
- Keep sensitive systems and data inside your environment.

**3) Safer execution of AI-generated software**
- Treat AI-generated code as untrusted by default.
- Use isolation and strong runtime limits to reduce blast radius if something goes wrong.

**4) Operational readiness**
- A practical approach to backups, recovery, and monitoring (so this isn’t a demo that fails in production).
- Designed so existing services keep running even if the “management” layer is temporarily unavailable.

**5) Clear accountability**
- Agent actions can be authenticated and recorded, supporting oversight and audit needs.

### What it can deploy (the things agencies actually need)

- **Internal web apps** (forms, dashboards, portals)
- **APIs and services** (integration layers, data services, workflow backends)
- **Background jobs** (report generation, scheduled processing)
- **Multi-service stacks** (when an app needs more than one component)

---

### Common government use cases

**Secure internal tooling**
- An analyst requests a new reporting dashboard.
- An AI assistant builds it, and ml.ink deploys it into an internal network segment with the right limits.

**Rapid response**
- Stand up a new intake form, status page, or coordination tool during an incident—fast, without bypassing controls.

**Modernization**
- Move legacy “scripts on a server” into managed, repeatable deployments that are easier to update and support.

**Evaluation environments**
- Quickly create isolated sandboxes for evaluating new tools or codebases without risking wider networks.

### How adoption works (a practical pilot)

1. **Start small**: deploy ml.ink into a pilot environment and onboard 1–2 mission teams.
2. **Define guardrails**: resource limits, allowed service types, and network rules that match your security posture.
3. **Scale**: expand to more teams and more runtime capacity once the operating model is proven.

### Bottom line

Government modernization requires speed **and** control. **ml.ink lets you use AI to deliver software faster while keeping deployments inside government infrastructure, with consistent guardrails and accountability.**

If you want the one-liner:

> **ml.ink is the “ship button” for AI-built software on government infrastructure.**
